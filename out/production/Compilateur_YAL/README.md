# Compilateur_YAL

This project is a compiler performed as part of our 3rd year in Computer Science degree at the Faculty of Sciences and Techonologies in Nancy (France).
This project is written in JAVA by Aur√©lien Blaise and Alexis Richer.
It works for a simple language called Yal.
An input file written in Yal is needed, and the output is the file compiled in MIPS.
